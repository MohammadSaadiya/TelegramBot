A simple Telegram bot to organize weekly football matches.  
The bot manages a players list, approvals, ball responsibility, and even shuffles players into teams.  
It also resets automatically every week and posts reminders on match day.

To use :
Clone the code and make sure to change the bot token to yours in the file 'env' .
for testing I recommend just running on terminal, but for activating the project I used heroku to commit the code and keeping it running 24/7 .
